# C References
This repository includes example C programs for students in BU's ENG EK 125 course that I'm a graduate teaching assistant for. These focus on strings, functions, pointers, and simple linked-lists. The hope is that these can serve as supplemental resources for the students who wish to see more examples.


The C programs in this repo covering the following:

- trav_ex. is an example of traversing a linked list
- strprac.c shows examples of using string functions in the string header file
- LL_Fun_with_Delete.c shows a general example of code to delete any element in a linked list, no matter where it is
- LL_Join.c illustrates how to combine two linked lists together

The PDF notes in this repo:

- General C Notes: goes over general programming concepts in C
- Intro to Dynamic Memory Allocation & Linked Lists in C: goes over DMA, pointers, and basic linked lists
